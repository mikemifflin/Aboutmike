            My understanding of what comes to be,</p>
            is only limiting my own reality,</p>
            define this life, which can twist and turn,</p>
            only to burn whats left to learn.</p>
            Unconditioned years of total blindness</p>
            focused on our mere sight of silence.</p>
            Darkness draped over our eyes wide shut,</p>
            deceiving and repeating lies lied shut.</p>
            Unlearn what you have learned in order to escape,</p>
            this prison that is created through our own dreamscape.</p>
            Break through the walls of our own demise,</p>
            and shine with divine inspirited minds.</p>
            But first we all must walk a path of that is unclear,</p>
            dampened by our egos and disguised with fear.</p>
            Almost destroying our well being of love,</p>
            damaging us until we plead from above.</p>
            Little do we know, above is within,</p>
            without is our hell which we all claim to live in.</p>
            Designed and defined by our thoughts of self,</p>
            the life that we create is like nothing else.
